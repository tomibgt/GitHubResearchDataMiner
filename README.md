GitHubResearchDataMiner
=======================

A python application to mine GitHub for research data

This application relies on jacquev6/PyGithub which should be included in your pydev
project, probably both by *New -> Link To Existing Source...* and as adviced
at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12519327/how-to-define-an-external-source-folder-in-pydevproject

You need to copy the config.cfg.template file under the name of config.cfg and populate it with proper
data.
